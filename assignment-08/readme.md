Learning HTML has been really cool. It's much more simple than I would have imagined but still challenging enough to keep me interested.

I'm a little anxious to learn CSS mostly because I'm only just starting to feel like I understand HTML and am worried that I may forget a lot by switching to another topic.

I visited the moodle page, and followed the step-by-step instructions on the class website, I then took the photos needed and wrote out the instructions for my page. Once I had all the material I needed I began coding in Atom and uploaded it through the github desktop app.
