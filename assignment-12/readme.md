Assignment 12

Imaginary Client:
My imaginary client was Cobra Kai Karate. The karate school home of the bad guys from the old-school Karate Kid movies that I loved when I was a kid. The company's needs are students that want to learn the way of the fist and how to sweep the leg.

Difference between display inline, block and inline-block:
Inline displays elements on the screen horizontally, block displays the elements vertically and inline-block displays the elements horizontally with space in between them.

Work Cycle:
I'll admit I probably spent the majority of my time on this assignment just figuring out an imaginary business, color scheme and theme for the site. It finally all started to click when youtube autoplayed the original karate kid movie while I was working. Once it all started coming together it got a lot smoother and then it was just a matter of finding the right images and content for the navigation bar.
