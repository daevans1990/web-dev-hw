Every page has one head and one body. The head elements tell the browser and processor information about the document such as the title, author and publication date. The body contains the bulk of the page's content that is rendered by the browser and displayed on the user's computer.

Structural markup embeds information about the structure of a document, such as headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. Semantic markup is used to reinforce the meaning of the information in a document with things like italics, bold font, and strikethrough.

For this assignment, I first read through the instructions on the moodle page, next I followed the step-by-step on the class website, and then did the readings in Duckett's HTML & CSS textbook. After reviewing the material I began building the site in atom and pushed it using the github desktop app.
