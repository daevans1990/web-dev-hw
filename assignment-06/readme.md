The standard "Contact Us" form is probably the form I see the most but I also see them used really often for things like multiple choice surveys and ratings.

Text is often used for things like usernames and passwords. Selection is used when user's are encouraged to choose from limited options. Buttons are clickable graphics used to add functionality to the site.

I visited the moodle page, and followed the step-by-step on the class website, then I viewed the source info on the draught works homepage. Once I had all the material I needed I began coding in Atom and uploaded it through the github desktop app.
