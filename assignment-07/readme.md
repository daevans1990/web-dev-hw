IDs are unique attributes that identify to a specific element. Classes group similar elements together by using the same name value. Divs are used to increase structural clarity and identify elements in block-level groups. Multiple span elements can exist within a div and serve to identify and/or group content together that requires organization or extra styling.

Alternative text is used to provide detailed descriptions for our images. This helps increase accessibility for those that are visually impaired and have to use screen readers.

I visited the moodle page, and followed the step-by-step instructions on the class website, I then used google to locate the album art, lyrics, video and audio for my page. Once I had all the material I needed I began coding in Atom and uploaded it through the github desktop app.
