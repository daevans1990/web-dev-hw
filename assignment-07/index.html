                  Okay
                  I'm feeling the way that I'm feeling myself
                  Fuck everyone else
                  Gotta remember that nobody's better than anyone else, here
                  (Do you need some time to think it over?)
                  Look what they do to you
                  Look what they do to me
                  Must be joking if you think that either one is free, here

                  Get up off your knees, girl
                  Stand face to face with your God
                  And follow what you are
                  (Hello, my name is human)
                  Hello, my name is human
                  And I came down from the stars
                  (Hello, my name is human)

                  I'm ready for love and I'm ready for war
                  But I'm ready for more
                  I know that nobody's ever been this fucking ready before, hey
                  (Do you need some time to think it over?)
                  So figure it out, or don't figure it out
                  I figured it out
                  The bigger the river (the bigger the river)
                  The bigger the drought (the bigger the drought)

                  Get up off your knees, boy
                  Stand face to face with your God
                  And find out what you are
                  (Hello, my name is human)
                  Hello, my name is human
                  And I came down from the stars
                  (Hello, my name is human)

                  Fire world, I love you
                  Fireworld

                  I'm up off my knees, girl
                  I'm face to face with myself
                  And I know who I am
                  (Hello, my name is human)
                  And I stole the power from the sun
                  I am more than just a man
                  (No longer disillusioned)
                  
                  I came down from the stars (so I'll take my chances)
                  (And what are the chances)
                  (That I could advance)
                  (On my own circumstances)
                  (Said "what are the chances?")
                  Hello, my name is human (And what are the chances?)
                  (I don't want your answers)
                  (I'm not asking questions)
                  (So you keep your answers)
                  And I know who I am (So you keep your answers)
                  (I'm not asking questions)
                  (I'm taking my chances)
