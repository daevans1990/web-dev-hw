I visited Google from 1999. I was surprised to see how much the home page still looks the same, except for the "beta" that was below the main Google emblem. All the basic components of the site look the same today as they did twenty years ago but they're just a little more polished now.

The GIT Module was pretty simple to use and understand but I'm not sure I understand the difference between uploading files through the desktop app and just uploading them through the website. They both seem pretty easy.
